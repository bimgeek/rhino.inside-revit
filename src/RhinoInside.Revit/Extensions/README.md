# Extensions

This folder contains extension methods for classes not defined in this assembly
and classes that from a logical point of view belong to an external namespace.

This code is for **internal** use only, if you are considering to expose any
class here DO move this class to a namespace under your control.

✔️ DO put extension methods in the same namespace as the extended type and
declare all *sponsor* classes as `internal` in order to prevent conflicts in
case this assembly is referenced from another one.

❌ DO NOT mix types from this assembly in the extension methods declared here.
This folder is for adding functionality that the external assembly might have
but does not have.
